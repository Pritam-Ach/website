                <p>Now the rumbling of the great organ swelled to a roar, press-

                    ing, like a rising giant, against the vaulted ceiling, to burst

                    through it.

                    Freder bent his head backwards, his wide-open, burning eyes

                    stared unseeingly upward. His hands formed music from the

                    chaos of the notes; struggling with the vibration of the sound

                    and stirring him to his innermost depths.

                    He was never so near tears in his life and, blissfully helpless,

                    he yielded himself up to the glowing moisture which dazzled

                    him.

                    Above him, the vault of heaven in lapis lazuli; hovering

                    therein, the twelve-fold mystery, the Signs of the Zodiac in

                    gold. Set higher above them, the seven crowned ones: the plan-

                    ets. High above all a silver-shining bevy of stars: the universe.

                    Before the bedewed eyes of the organ-player, to his music,

                    the stars of heavens began the solemn mighty dance.

                    The breakers of the notes dissolved the room into nothing.

                    The organ, which Freder played, stood in the middle of the sea.

                    It was a reef upon which the waves foamed. Carrying crests

                    of froth, they dashed violently onward, and the seventh was al-

                    ways the mightiest.

                    But high above the sea, which bellowed in the uproar of the

                    waves, the stars of heaven danced the solemn, mighty dance.

                    Shaken to her core, the old earth started from her sleep. Her

                    torrents dried up; her mountains fell to ruin. From the ripped

                    open depths the fire welled up; The earth burnt with all she

                    bore. The waves of the sea became waves of fire. The organ

                    flared up, a roaring torch of music. The earth, the sea and the hymn-blazing organ crashed in and became ashes.

                    But high above the deserts and the spaces, to which creation

                    was burnt, the stars of heaven danced the solemn mighty

                    dance.

                    4

                    Then, from the grey, scattered ashes, on trembling wings un-

                    speakably beautiful and solitary, rose a bird with jewelled

                    feathers. It uttered a mournful cry. No bird which ever lived

                    could have mourned so agonisingly.

                    It hovered above the ashes of the completely ruined earth. It

                    hovered hither and thither, not knowing where to settle. It

                    hovered above the grave of the sea and above the corpse of the

                    earth. Never, since the sinning angel fell from heaven to hell,

                    had the air heard such a cry of despair.

                    Then, from the solemn mighty dance of the stars, one freed

                    itself and neared the dead earth. Its light was gentler than

                    moonlight and more imperious than the fight of the sun.

                    Among the music of the spheres it was the most heavenly note.

                    It enveloped the mourning bird in its dear light; it was as

                    strong as a deity, crying: "To me… to me!"

                    Then the jewelled bird left the grave of the sea and earth and

                    gave its sinking wings up to the powerful voice which bore it.

                    Moving in a cradle of light, it swept upwards and sang, becom-

                    ing a note of the spheres, vanishing into Eternity…

                    Freder let his fingers slip from the keys. He bent forward and

                    buried his face in his hands. He pressed his eyes until he saw

                    the fiery dance of the stars behind his eyelids. Nothing could

                    help him—nothing. Everywhere, everywhere, in an agonising,

                    blissful omnipresence, stood, in his vision, the one one countenance.

                    The austere countenance of the virgin, the sweet counten-

                    ance of the mother—the agony and the desire with which he

                    called and called for the one single vision for which his racked

                    heart had not even a name, except the one, eternal, you…

                    you… you!

                    He let his hands sink and raised his eyes to the heights of the

                    beautifully vaulted room, in which his organ stood. From the

                    sea-deep blue of the heavens, from the flawless gold of the

                    heavenly bodies, from the mysterious twilight around him, the

                    girl looked at him with the deadly severity of purity, quite maid

                    and mistress, inviolability, graciousness itself, her beautiful

                    brow in the diadem of goodness, her voice, pity, every word a

                    song. Then to turn, and to go, and to vanish—no more to be

                    found. Nowhere, nowhere.

                    5

                    "You—!" cried the man. The captive note struck against the walls, finding no way out.

                    Now the loneliness was no longer bearable. Freder stood up

                    and opened the windows. The works lay, in quivering bright-

                    ness, before him. He pressed his eyes closed, standing still,

                    hardly breathing. He felt the proximity of the servants, stand-

                    ing silently, waiting for the command which would permit them

                    to come to life.

                    There was one among them—Slim, with his courteous face,

                    the expression of which never changed—Freder knew of him:

                    one word to him, and, if the girl still walked on earth with her

                    silent step, then Slim would find her. But one does not set a

                    blood-hound on the track of a sacred, white hind, if one does

                    not want to be cursed, and to be, all' his life long, a miserable, miserable man.</p>
